# gecs-boilerplate
A boilerplate project containing common entities, components, systems, and observers for GECS.

This is designed to be used both as a launching point skipping the GECS setup, as well as an extremely basic project used to learn how GECS is used in real time.
You can use this template in both styles of using GECS, both programmatically and visually through the editor.
